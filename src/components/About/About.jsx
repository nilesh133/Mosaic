                On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind
                Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a
                thousand times and everything that was left from its origin

                Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline
                of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran
                over her cheek, then she continued her way.
